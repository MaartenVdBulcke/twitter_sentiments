# BLUE SENTIMENTS: a Twitter sentiment analysis app

BLUE SENTIMENTS analyses sentiments of tweets. Users can 
provide a hashtag of their preference. The app will scrape
Twitter, preprocess the tweets and predict the sentiment. 

BLUE sentiments provides the user with the following features: 
+ a table showing the scraped, preprocessed tweets and the sentiment prediction
+ a graph showing the tweet sentiments ordered by day
+ a wordcloud with the most frequently found words

## NLP: Natural Language Processing

NLP is a powerful AI technique by which computers can handle 
natural language. 
I tested 3 pretrained sentiment analysis models on their accuracy.
All models were tested on the <a href=http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students target="blank_">Sentiment140 dataset</a>.
